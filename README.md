# Healthcare Price Transparency Project

This repository contains a pricing analysis project that explores hospital cost variability across the United States. The aim is to evaluate transparency in healthcare pricing and uncover patterns that can help both patients and policymakers make more informed decisions.

## Project Objective

With recent regulations requiring hospitals to publish service pricing, this project analyzes and visualizes this data to answer:

- How much do prices vary for common procedures across states?
- Are there identifiable patterns based on location or hospital type?
- Can we make this data more accessible through effective visualization?

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** â€“ Data cleaning and EDA
- **Tableau** â€“ Interactive dashboards
- **Excel** â€“ Supporting analysis and tabular summaries
